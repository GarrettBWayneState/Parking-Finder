# Parking-Finder-Wayne-State
IOS Mobile Application for finding parking spots on the side of the street at Wayne State.


## About:

This is a friendly IOS Mobile Application. The main purpose of this mobile-application is to find parking spots that are located on the side of the street on Wayne Stat's Campus. Trying to park on the side of the street is a problem since most of the spots have already been taken. What made me think of this idea was that my first day of one of my semester's being enrolled at Wayne State I went to get a pre-paid parking pass for any of the 13 parking structures on the Campus. However, on the first day all of them were taken, so I was left with the only other option to park on the side of the street. One day I had a quiz and couldn't find a spot for 30 minutes and failed the quiz. You can thank my failed quiz, since now there is a solution! Download this app so you don't end up like me.
